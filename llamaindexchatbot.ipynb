            "To customize an Okta-managed domain or use your own TLS certificate, you would need to have access to the Okta API Access Management administrator role. This role allows you to manage authorization servers, create and edit OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect client apps, and assign users and groups to these client apps. Additionally, you would need to ensure that all interactions and redirects between the user, the application, and Okta are secured using HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to protect credentials and tokens.\n",
            "To reference user attributes, you need to specify the profile scope and groups scope when requesting an ID token. By passing these scopes, you can ensure that the ID token returned by Okta contains all the profile attributes and groups associated with the user. This allows you to access and utilize the specific user attributes you require for your application or use case.\n",
            "The context information does not provide any information about beta releases or the release life cycle. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the query based on the given context.\n",
            "To create an authorization server, you can use Okta's API Access Management feature. This feature allows you to create one or more custom authorization servers hosted on Okta. These custom authorization servers make it easier to manage sets of API access for multiple client apps across different customer types. Within the authorization server, you can define scopes that are granular and specific to the permissions required. You can also define authorization policies and rules to control access to your APIs based on specific conditions. Additionally, you can specify the audience (aud claim) of the authorization server to reduce the risk of inappropriate access token reuse. It is recommended to assign one authorization server per API product to maintain separate authorization policies and token expiration times.\n"
